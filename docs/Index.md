## 🧠 Key Insights to Remember

1. **NeRF is fundamentally about volume rendering** - it learns to predict color and density at any 3D point, then integrates along rays

2. **The magic is implicit representation** - instead of explicit geometry, the scene is stored in neural network weights

3. **Positional encoding is crucial** - it helps the network learn high-frequency details that would otherwise be smoothed out

4. **Hierarchical sampling is an optimization** - coarse network finds where objects are, fine network adds detail

5. **Training is view synthesis** - the network learns 3D structure from 2D supervision alone
